            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I 
                like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to 
                see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to 
                look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.
                I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late;
                I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful
                west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books
                and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
            </p>

            <p>Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves, and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world - but economic growth is highly uneven. Much of its oil wealth lies in its separate Cabinda province, where a decades-long separatist conflict simmers</p>
